### Express.js Project
This is a simple and functional web application built using Express.js. The application includes four main pages:
- **Home**
- **Our Services**
- **Contact Us**
- **Error Page**

This web app uses a `Custom Access Restriction Middleware`: The application uses custom middleware to restrict access to the site during working hours (Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). 
This feature ensures the site is only accessible during specific business hours.


The project also uses `ESLint` to maintain code quality and consistency. ESLint helps in `identifying` and `fixing problems` in the `JavaScript code`, making the development process smoother and more efficient.
